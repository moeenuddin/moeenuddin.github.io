Over the past two years, I have had the privilege of serving on the Industrial Advisory Board (IAB) at FAST NUCES, Peshawar, and contributing as a mentor for the Data Science track at LUMS. These roles have allowed me to bridge academia and industry, ensuring students gain relevant skills for real-world challenges.

# FAST NUCES – Industrial Advisory Board

As an Industry advisory board - IAB member, I contributed to curriculum refinement, emphasizing modern technologies like cloud computing, AI, and big data analytics. I also guided faculty on integrating industry-driven projects and mentored students on career pathways, connecting them with internship and job opportunities.

# LUMS – Data Science Track Mentorship

At LUMS, I provided insights into structuring coursework, advised on industry trends, and mentored students on research and practical projects. My focus has been on equipping aspiring data scientists with the technical and strategic skills required for success.

# Looking Ahead

My engagement with both institutions has reinforced my commitment to fostering a strong academia-industry link. I look forward to continuing to support and mentor students, helping them navigate the evolving tech landscape.
