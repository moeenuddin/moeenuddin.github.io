# 💬 RAG-based Chatbot Demo – Context-Sensitive Q\&A

Welcome to the **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** chatbot demo!
This bot is designed to intelligently **query and answer questions** based on the context of a provided document—in this case, a **sample romantic book**.

🧠 **How it works**:

* Uses **retrieval-based techniques** to fetch the most relevant chunks from the uploaded book.
* Leverages **language generation** to produce coherent, context-aware answers.
* Ensures that answers are grounded in the source material.

📖 **Demo Source**:
A sample romantic novel has been included to test how well the chatbot understands and responds to questions from the story.

🚀 **Try it out here**:
