I am a passionate software engineer and researcher with over a decade of experience in backend development, AI/NLP, and data science. My journey bridges the gap between academic research and industry-driven development, enabling me to deliver cutting-edge solutions.

My expertise spans designing robust systems, developing scalable data pipelines, and deploying machine learning models in production environments. With a strong foundation in Node.js, Python, and Azure Cloud, I thrive on tackling complex challenges, whether it's optimizing infrastructure or exploring innovative AI applications.

On the research front, my work includes publications in social media analytics and AI-based systems. Iâ€™ve contributed to projects ranging from tweet classification to persona mapping and predictive modeling. I'm passionate about open-source contributions and building tools that make a tangible impact.
